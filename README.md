# **ML Projects Repository**
Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning (ML) Projects! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that I've developed as a beginner in the field of machine learning. This repository serves as a showcase of my learning journey and the practical applications of machine learning algorithms and techniques.

## **About**
As a beginner in machine learning, I've embarked on this journey to not only learn the theory behind ML algorithms but also to apply them to real-world problems. Each project in this repository represents a unique problem or dataset that I've tackled using various machine learning techniques.

All projects are very useful for ML beginners
